'The Hungry Dane!

Beneath the sky so vast and gray,
A Dane did wander far away.
His belly growled, his thirst was keen,
Yet not a scrap of food was seen.

Through cobbled streets and fields of gold,
With aching limbs and hunger cold,
He sniffed the air, he caught a trace—
The scent of bread, the scent of grace.

A tavern stood with doors flung wide,
Warm light and laughter lived inside.
The Dane, with eyes so sharp and bright,
Stepped forth to claim his feast that night.

He spied a roast, a wheel of cheese,
A foaming mug, a heart at ease.
Yet silver, none within his hand—
A beggar in a wealthy land.

But fortune favors those who dare,
And hunger’s voice is swift and rare.
With wit as sharp as battle steel,
He made a trade, he struck a deal.

A tale he spún of Viking lore,
Of dragons slain and distant shore.
The crowd did cheer, their hearts were swæd,
And thus, his hunger was repaid.

So if you roam where north winds wail,
And hunger gnaws without avail,
Just tell a tale, make hearts ignite—
A story feeds as well as bite.'
